# CapstoneDemo
This website represents a transition of CNCS captone content to a web based research, development and integration portfolio.  It leverages github pages to present a Capstone student's ongoing work to faculty, employers and peers.

## Github Pages setup advice
* Create your capstone repo with a readme
* clone your repo locally
* create a docs/index.md directory and file and commit
* enable Github pages
  * Select master/docs as a source
  * Optionally select a custom domain if you own one (you will have some DNS work to do)
