# CapstoneDemo
This website represents a transition of CNCS captone content to a web based research, development and integration portfolio.  It leverages github pages to present a Capstone student's ongoing work to faculty, employers and peers.

## Github Pages setup advice
* Create your capstone repo with a readme
* clone your repo locally
* create a docs directory and commit
