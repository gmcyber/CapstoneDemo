# CapstoneDemo
This website represents a transition of CNCS captone content to a web based research, development and integration portfolio.  It leverages either github pages or wiki functionaltiy to present a Capstone student's ongoing work to faculty, employers and peers.  Github pages is far more advanced and potentially more professional looking but required some time to learn, particularly if you are going to use Jekyll.  Here's the initial advice on github pages or Wiki setup.  This repo can be used for templates and examples on markup

## Github Pages setup advice
* Create your capstone repo with a readme
* clone your repo locally
* create a docs/index.md directory and file and commit
* enable Github pages
  * Select master/docs as a source
  * Optionally select a custom domain if you own one (you will have some DNS work to do)
  * Select a Jekyll thems
* You should now be able to go to your repo:  https://gmcyber.github.io/CapstoneDemo/
* Start hitting the youtubes and github pages documentation for how best to install and use ruby and Jekyll for your preferred operating system.

## Github Wiki Option
* This is pretty straight forward, you essentially just select the [Wiki Tab](https://github.com/gmcyber/CapstoneDemo/wiki) and author your content in any supported markup language as many of you have done in your tech-jounals for CNCS courses.

## Project Management
* Scheduling, Kanban boards, [Issues}(https://github.com/gmcyber/CapstoneDemo/issues) and Progress can be tracked using the [Projects Tab](https://github.com/gmcyber/CapstoneDemo/projects)
